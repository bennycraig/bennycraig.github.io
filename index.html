                <br>

                <p align="left">
                    I am a senior at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> studying computer science. 
                    I have worked as a Full Stack Engineer and Team Lead at <a href='https://learningclues.com/demo-search-function/'>LearningClues</a>. I am seeking work opportunities in 
                    I am interested in data journalism and data visualization, full-stack web technologies, ethical uses of machine learning, and creative programming.
                    <i>I am currently seeking work opportunities in web development and program management.</i>
                </p>

                <p align="left">
                    <!-- I'm passionate about community building efforts and bringing people together. -->
                    
                    Currently, I am a data volunteer at CAIR Coalition where I am working with the 
                    legal team to build their Immigration Judge Decision Bank, one of the first comprehensive immigration 
                    judge legal databases in the nation. 

                    As a transfer student passionate about mentorship and community-building in computer science, 
                    I have taken on various leadership positions. While at <a href="https://www.grcc.edu/">Grand Rapids Community College</a>,
                    I developed two years of experience tutoring calculus, physics, 
                    chemistry and writing classes. 
                    <!-- In an effort to build community at GRCC,  -->
                    I formed the GRCC Programmers club to provide collaborative opportunities for students interested in developing their programming skills together. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have an extensive background in research. As part of the <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/diversity-center/get-involved/micup/">MICUP Scholars Program</a>, I worked as a research assistant at Michigan Technological University studying computer microarchitectures.
                    
                    At University of Michigan, I have worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/event/croma-lab-research-showcase">Crowds + Machines Lab</a> developing a JavaScript simulator to model collaboration in teams.
                </p>

                <p align="left">
                    I also have a background in music performance studies and enjoy dabbling on the piano.
