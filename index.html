                    I worked as a Full Stack Engineer and Team Lead at <a href='https://learningclues.com/demo-search-function/'>LearningClues</a>, an education-tech startup whose search engine is used in over 450 courses at University of Michigan. 
                    <b>As an engineer</b>, I helped reduce server costs by migrating the backend to serverless REST APIs. I also aided in the redesign of their database to support secure LTI login. 
                    Additionally, I conducted user testing to guide the development of study features. 
                    <b>As a team lead</b>, I supported the team by developing project management documentation, organizing co-working sessions, and onboarding new engineers.

                    As a transfer student passionate about mentorship and community-building in computer science, 
                    I have taken on various leadership positions. While at <a href="https://www.grcc.edu/">Grand Rapids Community College</a>,
                    I developed two years of experience tutoring calculus, physics, 
                    chemistry and writing classes. 
                    <!-- In an effort to build community at GRCC,  -->
                    I formed the GRCC Programmers club to provide collaborative opportunities for students interested in developing their programming skills together.

                <p>
                    I have an extensive background in research. As part of the <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/diversity-center/get-involved/micup/">MICUP Scholars Program</a>, I worked as a research assistant at Michigan Technological University studying computer microarchitectures.
                    
                    At University of Michigan, I have worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/event/croma-lab-research-showcase">Crowds + Machines Lab</a> developing a JavaScript simulator to model collaboration in teams.

                    ðŸŽ¶ Before I began my journey into computer programming, I studied music at Oberlin Conservatory.
